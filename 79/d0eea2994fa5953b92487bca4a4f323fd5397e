There are already separate CI jobs for build and test (in test.yml).\n\nLet me also check what's in test.yml to confirm there are already build and test jobs there.\n\nActually, the user said \"build and test CI jobs\" already exist, so I should remove `build`, `test`, and `doc` jobs. Wait, the user said \"build and test\" - let me re-read. \"There are already build and test CI jobs, so remove them from the lint-format action.\" So remove `build` and `test` jobs. What about `doc`? The user didn't mention doc. Let me just remove build and test as requested.\n\n\nLooking at the commit history, this workflow was originally set up to handle lint, format, build, test, and doc checks all together. Since build and test already have their own dedicated CI jobs elsewhere, I should remove those two and keep format, lint, and doc in this workflow.",
