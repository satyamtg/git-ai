There's a critical behavior I need to understand:\n\nAfter alias resolution, the resolved `ParsedGitInvocation` is used both for hook dispatch AND for `proxy_to_git()` via `parsed_args.to_invocation_vec()`. This means if a user runs `git ci -m \"msg\"` (where `ci` is aliased to `commit -v`), the proxy_to_git call will send `commit -v -m msg` to real git, NOT `ci -m msg`.\n\n1. Read `src/git/cli_parser.rs` - find the `to_invocation_vec()` method and understand what it produces. Also look at the `Clone` derive or implementation on `ParsedGitInvocation`.\n\n2. This is potentially a problem or potentially intentional. When git-ai wraps git, the user runs `git ci` which actually runs the git-ai binary. If git-ai expands the alias and sends `git commit -v -m msg` to real git, that should work fine because real git doesn't need to resolve the alias again. BUT - check if there's any issue with the `clone` special case on line 120 of git_handlers.rs - could someone alias `clone` and it wouldn't be caught?\n\n3. Look for the `find_repository_in_path` function - how does it differ from `find_repository`? Is it correctly used in the tests?\n\n4. Check how `proxy_to_git` is called - does it pass the original args or the resolved args? Look at handle_git carefully.\n\n5.

          "type": "assistant",
          "text": "Great findings so far. Let me now synthesize everything and think about what's missing. Let me also check a few more things:\n\n1. The clone alias bug is a good finding but actually - if someone aliases `clone`, there won't be a repository yet (that's the whole point of the clone special case). So `find_repository` would fail, `repository_option` would be `None`, `has_repo` would be `false`, and the code would skip to the else branch at line 167-170 which just calls `proxy_to_git` without any hooks. So the alias resolution for clone is actually a non-issue in a way - clone always runs without a repo, so alias resolution (which needs a repo) can't work for it anyway. Let me think about this more carefully...\n   \nActually, I'm realizing the real issue: `find_repository` gets called before we even check if the command is clone. If there's no repo, the function fails early, so whether the command is an aliased clone or something else, we'd just proxy it directly without any hook processing. The aliased clone would bypass hooks entirely because we never get far enough to resolve the alias or recognize it as a clone operation. from global config even without a repo. This would require using `git config --global --get alias.cl` or similar. But the current implementation requires a `Repository` object.\n\nThis is an edge case but worth noting in the plan. Let me also think about other missing tests.\n\nCurrent tests cover alias resolution with arguments, chained aliases, cycles, self-recursion, shell aliases, and quote parsing. Missing from the test suite are cases like non-alias commands passing through unchanged, which I should add to ensure the resolver handles regular git commands correctly.\n\nI also need to test how global arguments interact with alias resolution, whether aliased commands actually trigger their corresponding hooks in an end-to-end scenario, and edge cases like empty alias values, double-quote parsing, and commands with only global arguments. There's also the question of what happens with incomplete alias definitions.\n\nLooking at the `resolve_alias_invocation` behavior, when it returns `None` for cycles or shell aliases, the original command stays unchanged, which means pre-hooks won't match any known command and won't run. I should verify this behavior is correct and test the proxy mechanism to ensure the expanded command is what git actually receives.\n\nThere's also a copilot comment about fixing spacing after a comma in \"currently\". For the test wrapper function with the `_test` suffix, I'm considering whether there's a cleaner pattern using `#[cfg(test)]` or `pub(crate)` instead of the current public approach.\n\nNow I'm working through the edge cases in `parse_alias_tokens` — empty strings and whitespace-only input both return empty token vectors, shell aliases starting with `!` return `None`, and unclosed quotes also return `None`. The interesting case is adjacent quotes like `'a'\"b\"` which would merge into a single token since quotes just toggle parsing modes rather than creating boundaries. The trailing backslash behavior is worth examining more closely.\n\nIf an alias value ends with a backslash, the parser pushes it as a literal character rather than treating it as a line continuation like bash would, but that's acceptable for git alias values. I'm also checking whether `parse_alias_tokens` properly handles cases where the tokenized result contains only global arguments with no actual command — for instance, an alias like `\"-c foo=bar commit\"` would correctly separate the global args from the command, but an alias that's just `\"-c foo=bar\"` with no command following would need to be traced through to see how it's handled.\n\nLooking at the flow, when there's no command after parsing, the function returns with `command` set to `None`, which is fine since no command means no hooks would trigger. Now I'm thinking through the `proxy_to_git` behavior and whether git might try to resolve an alias a second time — but it shouldn't, since git only resolves aliases based on the first argument after global options, and we'd be sending an already-expanded command like `commit -v -m msg` where `commit` is a built-in, not an alias. There's a potential ordering issue with `to_invocation_vec()` that I need to verify...\n\nChecking the method signature...\n\nBuilding the invocation vector...\n\nWait, there's something off here — the function pushes `--` before the command, but in git's CLI, `--` typically comes after the command to separate options from pathspecs. If `--` appears before the command, that signals the end of global options, which changes how git interprets what follows.\n\nLet me trace through the parser logic. When `saw_end_of_opts` is true, it means `--` was encountered in the input. The reconstruction puts it before the command, which would match the \"end of global options\" semantics. But if the original input had `--` for pathspec separation (after the command), this reconstruction would place it incorrectly. That said, this seems like a pre-existing issue unrelated to alias resolution.\n\nNow I need to pull together the key findings and recommendations.\n\nI've identified a few issues worth addressing: a typo in a comment, an edge case with clone aliases that's tricky to fix since we need a repo to resolve aliases but clone happens before one exists, and a code smell around the test wrapper function. I should also note some missing test coverage—verifying that non-aliased commands pass through unchanged, that global arguments like `-C` are preserved after resolution, and a few other scenarios that aren't currently tested.\n\nNow I'm thinking through what test coverage would actually matter most. The E2E tests for `git ci` triggering commit hooks and `git p` triggering push hooks are probably the most critical, since they verify the whole feature works end-to-end. I should also add unit tests for the alias parser itself with edge cases like empty values, whitespace, quotes, and escaped characters. There's also the question of how to handle special markers like `--end-of-options` in aliases.\n\nLet me look at how the existing integration tests are structured to understand the pattern better.",

I need two things:\n\n1. **Clone alias analysis**: In `src/commands/git_handlers.rs`, the clone check at line 120 happens BEFORE alias resolution. But alias resolution at line 140 requires a `Repository` object, and for `clone` there is no repo yet. So if someone aliases `clone`, what actually happens? Trace through:\n   - `find_repository` at line 101 would fail (no repo) → `repository_option = None`, `has_repo = false`\n   - Clone check at line 120: command is the alias name (e.g., \"cl\"), not \"clone\" → skips\n   - Main hook path at line 127: `has_repo = false` → skips\n   - Falls to line 169: `proxy_to_git` with original args (including alias name)\n   - Git itself resolves the alias and runs clone\n   \n   So clone aliases work functionally but skip clone hooks. Is this a real concern? Read `src/commands/hooks/clone_hooks.rs` to understand what clone hooks do.\n\n2. **E2E test patterns**: I need to understand how existing integration tests verify hook behavior. Look at:\n   - `tests/` directory - list all test files and pick 2-3 that test hook behavior for commit or push\n   - Read one commit-related test file to understand the pattern (how TestRepo is used to trigger commits and verify authorship behavior)\n   - Look at `tests/e2e/user-scenarios.bats` to understand bash-level e2e tests\n   - Look at any test that verifies hooks ran correctly (not just unit tests of alias parsing)\n\n3. **Check if there's a `parse_alias_tokens` unit test module**: Are there any `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` blocks within `git_handlers.rs`? Or are all tests in the external test file?\n\nBe thorough - I need to know the e2e testing patterns to recommend proper integration tests.",

          "type": "assistant",
          "text": "Now I have a comprehensive understanding. Let me also quickly check one more thing - how `parse_alias_tokens` is tested. The existing tests go through the full `resolve_alias_invocation_test` flow which includes `parse_alias_tokens`, but there are no direct unit tests for `parse_alias_tokens` itself. Let me think about what's missing:\n\nMissing unit tests for `parse_alias_tokens`:\n1. Empty string\n2. Whitespace-only\n3. Double quotes\n4. Mixed quotes: `'foo'\"bar\"`\n5. Escaped characters in double quotes\n6. Trailing backslash\n7. Adjacent tokens with no whitespace between quotes\n\n\n8. Non-alias command passes through unchanged\n9. Global args preserved after resolution\n10. Alias resolving to a hooked command triggers hooks (e2e)\n11. Alias with `--` end-of-options marker\n\nNow I'm realizing the clone alias issue is more fundamental - the clone alias can only exist in global or system config since there's no repository yet, but `config_get_str` relies on a repository object to access config. Since `find_repository` fails before clone, we can't resolve aliases at that point even if we wanted to.\n\nI think the most practical approach is to accept this limitation and document it rather than trying to add new config-reading capabilities. It's an edge case anyway.\n\nNow I'm tracing through what happens when `resolve_alias_invocation` returns `None` - whether from a cycle or shell alias - the original `parsed_args` stays unchanged. For shell aliases like `!cmd`, the command name remains the alias itself, so when it gets proxied to git, git will see the alias name rather than the expanded command.\n\nThere's a subtle interaction here: when we proxy an unresolved alias to git, git will resolve it itself, but git-ai's hooks won't run on the resolved command. That's intentional for shell aliases, and for cycles git will just error out anyway.\n\nI'm also considering another edge case - when someone runs `git ci -m \"msg\"` where `ci` is aliased to `commit -v`...\n\nActually, I need to think through whether git aliases can shadow built-in commands. Git does allow this by default, so if someone had `alias.commit = \"commit --verbose\"` and ran `git ci`, we'd expand it to `commit -v -m \"msg\"` and send that to git, which would then try to resolve `commit` as an alias again. This could create unexpected behavior.\n\nOur implementation would detect this cycle and return None, passing the original command to git instead, but git itself handles alias expansion differently—it only expands once to prevent infinite recursion. So there's a subtle difference in how we're handling recursive alias resolution compared to git's actual behavior.\n\nThis edge case where someone aliases a built-in command is unusual enough that I think documenting it as a known limitation is reasonable rather than trying to match git's exact behavior perfectly.\n\nNow I'm thinking about the test infrastructure - specifically whether I should use a conditional compilation approach with a test-support feature flag to expose the resolver function for testing, or if the current integration test pattern is sufficient. Still writing test wrapper...\n\nI think the `_test` wrapper approach is simpler and more pragmatic than adding a feature flag, so I'll keep it as-is and just note it as a minor cleanup opportunity. Now I'm identifying the actual bugs and limitations in the implementation—there's a comment typo to fix, and I need to document the known limitations around clone aliases and built-in command shadowing.\n\nLooking at the None behavior more carefully: when alias resolution returns None (either from a shell alias or a cycle), the original command gets passed to git, which handles it correctly. Hooks don't run in this case, which is fine for shell aliases but creates an edge case where hooks are incorrectly skipped for built-in shadowing aliases, though that's an unusual scenario.\n\nI'm also noticing the `.map()` usage for the side effect of reassigning `parsed_args` is a bit unconventional—normally you'd use `if let Some()` or `.unwrap_or_else()` instead. It works correctly, but there's likely a Clippy lint flagging this pattern.",

            "content": "# Plan: Git Alias Resolution PR (#435) - Remediation\n\n## Context\n\nPR #435 adds native git alias resolution so that aliased commands (e.g., `git ci` → `git commit`) correctly trigger git-ai's pre/post command hooks. The core implementation is solid: aliases are resolved before hook dispatch, cycles are detected, shell aliases (`!cmd`) are passed through, and quote parsing is robust. However, there are missing tests, minor code issues, and edge cases to address.\n\n## 1. Fix comment typo (Copilot review suggestion)\n\n**File:** `src/commands/git_handlers.rs:223`\n\nChange `\"command,currently\"` → `\"command, currently\"` (add space after comma).\n\n## 2. Use idiomatic `if let` instead of `Option::map` for side effect\n\n**File:** `src/commands/git_handlers.rs:140`\n\n```rust\n// Current (non-idiomatic side-effect in map):\nresolve_alias_invocation(&parsed_args, repository).map(|resolved| parsed_args = resolved);\n\n// Change to:\nif let Some(resolved) = resolve_alias_invocation(&parsed_args, repository) {\n    parsed_args = resolved;\n}\n```\n\n## 3. Add unit tests for `parse_alias_tokens`\n\n**File:** `src/commands/git_handlers.rs` — add `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` block\n\nThese test the token parser directly without needing a git repo:\n\n| Test | Input | Expected |\n|------|-------|----------|\n| Empty string | `\"\"` | `Some(vec![])` |\n| Whitespace only | `\"  \\t  \"` | `Some(vec![])` |\n| Shell alias | `\"!echo hello\"` | `None` |\n| Double quotes | `\"log \\\"--format=%H\\\"\"` | `Some([\"log\", \"--format=%H\"])` |\n| Mixed adjacent quotes | `\"--pretty='format:%h %s'\"` | `Some([\"--pretty=format:%h %s\"])` |\n| Unclosed single quote | `\"log 'unclosed\"` | `None` |\n| Unclosed double quote | `\"log \\\"unclosed\"` | `None` |\n| Escaped char outside quotes | `\"log \\\\--oneline\"` | `Some([\"log\", \"\\--oneline\"])` (backslash consumed, next char literal) |\n| Trailing backslash | `\"commit\\\\\"` | `Some([\"commit\\\\\"])` |\n\n## 4. Add missing integration tests for `resolve_alias_invocation`\n\n**File:** `tests/git_alias_resolution.rs` — add these test cases:\n\n| Test | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| `non_alias_passthrough` | A normal command (e.g., `commit`) with no alias defined returns unchanged |\n| `global_args_preserved` | `git -c user.name=X ci -m msg` (where `ci=commit`) preserves `-c user.name=X` in global_args |\n| `alias_to_non_hooked_command` | `alias.s = status` resolves to `command = \"status\"` (passes through correctly even though no hooks match) |\n| `alias_with_no_extra_args` | `alias.ci = commit` with no additional args → `command = \"commit\"`, `command_args = []` |\n| `alias_with_double_quotes` | `alias.lg = log \"--format=%H %s\"` respects double-quoted tokens |\n\n## 5. Add E2E integration test: aliased commit triggers hooks\n\n**File:** `tests/git_alias_resolution.rs` (or new file `tests/git_alias_e2e.rs`)\n\nThis is the most important missing test — verifying that the full hook pipeline works through an alias:\n\n```\n1. Create TestRepo\n2. Set alias: git config alias.ci \"commit\"\n3. Create a file, write content, trigger checkpoint (human)\n4. AI modifies the file, trigger checkpoint (AI)\n5. Stage and run `git-ai ci -m \"test\"` (using the alias)\n6. Verify: commit succeeded (exit code 0)\n7. Verify: authorship log was written (post-commit hook ran)\n8. Verify: blame shows correct AI/human attribution\n```\n\nThis proves the full chain: alias resolution → pre-commit hook (checkpoint) → proxy to git → post-commit hook (authorship log).\n\n## 6. Add E2E test: aliased push triggers hooks\n\nSimilar to above but for push, to verify a second hook type works through aliases. Use `TestRepo::new_with_remote()` to test `alias.p = push`.\n\n## 7. Remove `resolve_alias_invocation_test` wrapper — use `test-support` feature\n\n**File:** `src/commands/git_handlers.rs:174-180`\n\nThe `_test` suffix public wrapper pattern is a code smell. The codebase already uses `#[cfg(feature = \"test-support\")]` in `src/git/mod.rs`. Apply the same pattern:\n\n```rust\n// Remove the _test wrapper, make the real function conditionally public:\n#[cfg(not(feature = \"test-support\"))]\nfn resolve_alias_invocation(...) -> Option<ParsedGitInvocation> { ... }\n\n#[cfg(feature = \"test-support\")]\npub fn resolve_alias_invocation(...) -> Option<ParsedGitInvocation> { ... }\n```\n\nUpdate the test import to use `resolve_alias_invocation` directly.\n\n## 8. Document known limitation: clone aliases\n\nClone aliases (e.g., `alias.cl = clone`) can't trigger clone hooks because:\n- Clone runs before a repository exists\n- Alias resolution requires a repository to read git config\n- Global config could theoretically be read, but that requires a new code path\n\n**Action:** Add a brief code comment at the clone special-case (line 120) noting this limitation. This is acceptable for now since aliasing `clone` is uncommon.\n\n## Files to modify\n\n| File | Changes |\n|------|---------|\n| `src/commands/git_handlers.rs` | Fix typo, idiomatic `if let`, add unit tests module, refactor test wrapper visibility |\n| `tests/git_alias_resolution.rs` | Add missing integration tests (passthrough, global args, non-hooked, no extra args, double quotes) |\n| `tests/git_alias_e2e.rs` (new) or extend existing | E2E tests for aliased commit and push with full hook verification |\n\n## Verification\n\n1. `cargo test --features test-support` — all new and existing tests pass\n2. `cargo test git_alias` — specifically run the alias test suite\n3. `cargo clippy` — no new warnings\n4. Manual verification: set `alias.ci = commit` in a test repo, run `git-ai ci -m \"test\"`, verify authorship log exists\n",

This works because integration tests in `tests/` compile against the library target of the crate.\n\nBut the E2E tests that use `TestRepo` work differently - they spawn the `git-ai` binary as a subprocess.

Verify: blame shows correct AI/human attribution\n```\n\nThis proves the full chain: alias resolution → pre-commit hook (checkpoint) → proxy to git → post-commit hook (authorship log).\n\n## 6. Add E2E test: aliased push triggers hooks\n\n**File:** `tests/git_alias_resolution.rs`\n\nSimilar to above but for push, to verify a second hook type works through aliases. Use `TestRepo::new_with_remote()` to test `alias.p = push`.\n\n## 7. Remove `resolve_alias_invocation_test` wrapper — use `test-support` feature\n\n**File:** `src/commands/git_handlers.rs:174-180`\n\nThe `_test` suffix public wrapper pattern is a code smell. The codebase already uses `#[cfg(feature = \"test-support\")]` in `src/git/mod.rs`. This works because:\n- Integration tests (`tests/*.rs`) compile against the lib with `test-support` via `[dev-dependencies] git-ai = { path = \".\", features = [\"test-support\"] }` (Cargo.toml:40)\n- The binary spawned by `TestRepo` is also built with `--features test-support` (test_repo.rs:634)\n\nApply the same pattern:\n\n```rust\n// Remove the _test wrapper, make the real function conditionally public:\n#[cfg(not(feature = \"test-support\"))]\nfn resolve_alias_invocation(...) -> Option<ParsedGitInvocation> { ... }\n\n#[cfg(feature = \"test-support\")]\npub fn resolve_alias_invocation(...) -> Option<ParsedGitInvocation> { ... }\n```\n\nUpdate the test import to use `resolve_alias_invocation` directly.\n\n## 8. Document known limitation: clone aliases\n\nClone aliases (e.g., `alias.cl = clone`) can't trigger clone hooks because:\n- Clone runs before a repository exists\n- Alias resolution requires a repository to read git config\n- Global config could theoretically be read, but that requires a new code path\n\n**Action:** Add a brief code comment at the clone special-case (line 120) noting this limitation. This is acceptable for now since aliasing `clone` is uncommon.\n\n## Files to modify\n\n| File | Changes |\n|------|---------|\n| `src/commands/git_handlers.rs` | Fix typo, idiomatic `if let`, add unit tests module, refactor test wrapper visibility |\n| `tests/git_alias_resolution.rs` | Add missing integration tests (passthrough, global args, non-hooked, no extra args, double quotes) |\n| `tests/git_alias_e2e.rs` (new) or extend existing | E2E tests for aliased commit and push with full hook verification |\n\n## Verification\n\n1. `cargo test --features test-support` — all new and existing tests pass\n2. `cargo test git_alias` — specifically run the alias test suite\n3. `cargo clippy` — no new warnings\n4. Manual verification: set `alias.ci = commit` in a test repo, run `git-ai ci -m \"test\"`, verify authorship log exists\n"

Check if there's a way to run `git-ai ci` (aliased command) through the TestRepo harness.\n\nI need concrete code examples I can follow for:\n- Running an aliased commit through git-ai and verifying authorship log exists\n- Running an aliased push through git-ai and verifying push hooks ran\n\nBe thorough with code examples.",

Let me think about one important detail:\n\nThe `repo.commit()` method uses `repo.git_with_env(&[\"commit\", \"-m\", message], ...)`. It passes `\"commit\"` directly, not the alias. So if I want to test an aliased commit, I can't use `repo.commit()` directly because it hardcodes \"commit\".\n\nInstead, I need to:\n1. Set up the alias in the repo config\n2. Use `repo.git(&[\"ci\", \"-m\", \"msg\"])` directly (where \"ci\" is the alias)\n\n\n3. Then manually check if authorship log was written\n\nLooking at how the `commit()` method is structured, I need to understand its implementation to see if I can adapt it for testing aliases. Examining the method signature and how it delegates to `commit_with_env`...\n\nThe core issue is that `commit()` hardcodes the \"commit\" command, so for alias testing I'll need to call `repo.git()` directly with the alias like \"ci\", then verify the authorship log was created by checking the HEAD commit's notes. The simplest approach is to set up an alias, create a file with AI content through a checkpoint, stage and commit using the alias via `repo.git()`, then verify the authorship log exists.\n\nNow I'm realizing the verification flow: I need to check that the commit succeeded, then use the blame assertion to verify authorship was recorded. But looking at how the test patterns work, the `.ai()` and `.human()` markers on `set_contents` are actually for the assertion side, not for setting up the content itself. The actual flow is to write human content, run a human checkpoint, write AI content, run an AI checkpoint on that file, then stage and commit before verifying with blame. to understand the actual flow better. Let me look at what `set_contents` does and how checkpoints work. Actually, I think I should just find a simple existing test like the one in amend.rs and follow that pattern exactly instead of trying to reverse-engineer it.",

For the push test, I'd set up both local and upstream repos with a push alias, then verify the authorship notes get pushed to the remote.\n\nLooking at the `lines!` macro, it converts expressions into expected lines where plain strings are human-attributed by default, and I can use `.ai()` to mark lines as AI-generated.\n\nFor the E2E commit test, the flow is straightforward: the alias gets resolved, the pre-commit hook captures the checkpoint, git executes the commit, the post-commit hook logs authorship, and then I can verify everything with blame. The `assert_lines_and_blame` method handles all that verification in one call.\n\nWhen `repo.git()` is invoked, git-ai resolves the alias because it runs the binary with the right environment variable, routes through `handle_git()`, and reads the alias configuration.

          "text": "The push E2E test is failing because line 2 \"    return True\" is attributed to \"Test User\" (human) instead of \"mock_ai\" (AI). This is likely because `insert_at` on line 270 inserts content, and the way the test file tracks authorship, the original \"return True\" line was modified/shifted.\n\nLooking at the blame output:\n```\naf9e4b5 (mock_ai   2026-02-06 22:55:42 -0500 1) def ai_func():\n6b46398 (Test User 2026-02-06 22:55:43 -0500 2)     return True\n\n\n```\n\nSo `return True` is attributed to \"Test User\" (human). But the original `set_contents` set it as `.ai()`. The issue is that after `insert_at`, when we commit, the blame says it's human because the line was modified in the second commit. Wait, let me look at this more carefully.\n\nThe content mismatch also shows: expected \"    return True\" but actual is \"return True\" (no indentation). So there's also a content issue.\n\nActually, looking at the blame output more carefully, I see that the third line with the AI-generated comment is now attributed to \"mock_ai\" with the same timestamp as the second commit. This suggests the authorship tracking is getting confused about which lines belong to which author after the insertion happens.\n\nLet me trace through what's happening: when we insert a line at position 2, it shifts the original `return True` down, and then when we commit that change, Git's blame algorithm attributes the modified line to whoever made that commit. The authorship metadata we set with `.ai()` isn't being preserved through the insertion and commit cycle. Looking at the blame output, I see that `return True` on line 2 is attributed to the second commit with \"Test User\" as the author, while the comment on line 3 is attributed to the same commit but with \"mock_ai\" as the author—this inconsistency suggests the `insert_at` method might be modifying the indentation or whitespace of existing lines when inserting new content. The issue is that `set_contents` doesn't preserve trailing newlines, so when `insert_at` adds a new line after `return True`, git detects the modification because that line now has a newline character it didn't have before. This is a known git behavior where files without trailing newlines are treated differently.\n\nLooking at the blame output, the attribution to \"Test User\" confirms git is seeing this as a changed line in the second commit. The real problem is the test setup doesn't account for this edge case—I should either add more initial content to separate the inserted line from the file's end, or accept that this particular line will be attributed to the human author.\n\nThe deeper issue is that git-ai's blame tool should be consulting authorship notes rather than relying solely on git blame output. Even if git blame attributes the line to \"Test User,\" the authorship notes should preserve the original AI attribution if they were written correctly during the checkpoint process. I see the issue now—when `insert_at` rewrites the entire file, git detects a modification to line 2 (the trailing newline change) that gets attributed to the human author since only the inserted lines are marked as AI during the checkpoint. I should simplify the test to avoid this edge case.\n\nThe cleanest fix is to create two separate commits with different files instead of modifying the existing one, then push the second commit through the alias.",

Here's a summary of the implementation:\n\n## Changes Made\n\n### 1. `src/commands/git_handlers.rs`\n- Added import for `VirtualAttributions`\n- Added `stashed_va: Option<VirtualAttributions>` field to `CommandHooksContext`\n- Separated `pull` from `fetch` in both pre-command and post-command hooks to allow special handling\n\n### 2. `src/commands/hooks/fetch_hooks.rs`\nAdded the following new functions:\n\n- **`is_pull_with_rebase()`** - Detects if rebase mode is active by checking:\n  - CLI flags: `--rebase`, `-r`, `--no-rebase`\n  - Git config: `pull.rebase`\n\n- **`is_pull_with_autostash()`** - Detects if autostash is active by checking:\n  - CLI flags: `--autostash`, `--no-autostash`\n  - Git config: `rebase.autoStash`\n\n- **`has_uncommitted_changes()`** - Checks if working directory has changes that would trigger autostash\n\n- **`pull_pre_command_hook()`** - When rebase+autostash+changes detected:\n  1. Captures HEAD before pull\n  2. Builds `VirtualAttributions::from_just_working_log()`\n  3. Stores VA in `command_hooks_context.stashed_va`\n\n- **`pull_post_command_hook()`** - After successful pull with HEAD change:\n  1. Takes the stashed VA from context\n  2. Reads working directory file contents (final state after autostash apply)\n  3. Merges stashed VA with new VA using `merge_attributions_favoring_first()`\n  4. Writes result as INITIAL attributions for the new HEAD\n\nThe implementation ensures that when a user runs `git pull --rebase --autostash` (or has these configured), their uncommitted AI-attributed code is preserved through git's internal stash operations.",

          "text": "Commit all work as a series of atomic, logically sequenced commits. Each commit should represent one coherent change that can be understood, reviewed, and reverted independently.\n\n# Commit Decomposition Principles\n\n**Scope each commit to a single logical change.** A commit should do exactly one thing: add a function, fix a bug, refactor a module, update documentation. If you find yourself writing \"and\" in a commit message, consider splitting the commit.\n\n**Sequence commits to tell a story.** Arrange commits so each builds naturally on the previous. A reviewer reading the series should understand why each change was made and how the code evolved. Foundational changes come before dependent ones.\n\n**Keep each commit in a working state.** Every commit should compile, pass tests, and not introduce obvious regressions. This enables bisection for debugging and allows reviewers to check out any point in history.\n\n# Categorizing Changes\n\nBefore committing, analyze the working tree and group changes into categories:\n\n1. **Infrastructure/setup changes** — new dependencies, configuration, tooling\n2. **Refactoring** — restructuring existing code without changing behavior\n3. **New functionality** — features, APIs, modules\n4. **Bug fixes** — corrections to existing behavior\n5. **Tests** — new or modified test coverage\n6. **Documentation** — comments, READMEs, inline docs\n\nCommit these categories in order when dependencies exist between them. Refactoring that enables a new feature should precede the feature commit.\n\n# Commit Message Format\n\n```\n<summary>\n\n<body>\n\n<footer>\n```\n\n**Summary line:** Imperative mood, no period, under 50 characters. Describe what applying the commit does, not what you did.\n\n**Body:** Explain the motivation and contrast with previous behavior. Wrap at 72 characters. Focus on *why*, not *what* (the diff shows what).\n\n**Footer:** Reference issues, breaking changes, or co-authors.\n\n# Staging Strategy\n\nUse selective staging to craft precise commits:\n\n- `git add -p` for hunks within files\n- `git add <specific-files>` to group related files\n- Review staged changes with `git diff --staged` before committing\n\nWhen a single file contains changes belonging to multiple logical commits, stage hunks separately rather than committing the entire file.\n\n# Quality Checklist\n\nBefore finalizing each commit:\n\n- [ ] Does this commit do exactly one thing?\n- [ ] Could someone understand this change without seeing other commits?\n- [ ] Is the commit message searchable? Will someone find this when grepping history?\n- [ ] Does the code compile and pass tests at this point?\n- [ ] Would reverting this commit cleanly undo one logical change?\n\n# Example Decomposition\n\nGiven work that adds a feature with tests and required refactoring:\n\n```\n1. Extract token validation into dedicated module\n2. Add unit tests for token validation\n3. Implement refresh token rotation\n4. Add integration tests for token refresh flow\n5. Document refresh token behavior in API guide\n```\n\nEach commit is independently reviewable, the sequence shows logical progression, and future developers can find relevant changes through targeted searches.\n\n# Handling Mixed Changes\n\nIf the working tree contains entangled changes:\n\n1. **Identify the distinct changes** — list what logical modifications exist\n2. **Determine dependencies** — which changes require others to be present\n3. **Create a commit plan** — order commits to satisfy dependencies\n4. **Stage incrementally** — use partial staging to isolate each change\n5. **Verify at each step** — ensure the repository works after each commit\n\nWhen changes are too entangled to separate cleanly, prefer a slightly larger commit with a clear message over a commit that leaves the repository in a broken state.\n",
